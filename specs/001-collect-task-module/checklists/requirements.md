# Specification Quality Checklist: Collect Task Module

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is ready for the next phase.

### Detailed Review

#### Content Quality
- ✅ **No implementation details**: Specification focuses on user interactions and business requirements without mentioning specific technologies (Rust, Dioxus, database drivers, etc.)
- ✅ **User-focused**: All stories written from data engineer perspective with clear value propositions
- ✅ **Non-technical language**: Describes what the system should do, not how it should be built
- ✅ **Complete sections**: All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are filled with concrete details

#### Requirement Completeness
- ✅ **No clarifications needed**: All requirements are specific and unambiguous. Made informed assumptions about:
  - Auto-save frequency (30 seconds - industry standard for web apps)
  - Validation timing (500ms - standard for real-time feedback)
  - Performance targets (based on typical data platform expectations)
- ✅ **Testable requirements**: Every FR can be verified with observable behavior (e.g., "displays available tables", "allows selecting fields")
- ✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All SC items include specific metrics (time, percentage, count)
- ✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: No mention of frameworks, databases, or implementation technologies in SC section
- ✅ **Complete acceptance scenarios**: Each user story has detailed Given-When-Then scenarios covering the full workflow
- ✅ **Edge cases identified**: 10 edge cases covering error scenarios, validation, and system failures
- ✅ **Clear scope**: Feature boundaries are well-defined with 4 prioritized user stories
- ✅ **Dependencies documented**: Feature relies on existing datasource and resource management (referenced in FR-003 and FR-004)

#### Feature Readiness
- ✅ **FR-to-Acceptance mapping**: Each functional requirement can be traced to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✅ **Primary flows covered**: All 4 collection mode combinations (Full/Incremental × Database/API) have dedicated user stories
- ✅ **Measurable outcomes**: 10 success criteria provide clear validation targets
- ✅ **No implementation leakage**: Specification maintains abstraction from technical implementation

### Notes

The specification is complete and high-quality. No updates required before proceeding to `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

**Assumptions Made** (reasonable defaults, no clarification needed):
1. Auto-save frequency: 30 seconds (standard for web applications)
2. Validation timing: 500ms for real-time feedback (UX best practice)
3. Task creation time: 5-7 minutes (based on similar ETL configuration workflows)
4. Schema mapping accuracy: 95% (realistic for automated type conversion)
5. Pipeline publish time: 3 seconds (reasonable for API communication)
6. Concurrent datasource support: 100 (sufficient for individual user platform)
7. First-task success rate: 90% (ambitious but achievable with good UX)
