# Stories

## Story 1: DAG Visual Designer Interface
**Goal:** Create data-terminal UI component for drag-and-drop DAG creation using existing MySQL pipeline tasks with visual workflow representation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Visual canvas for DAG creation with drag-and-drop functionality
- Task palette showing available pipeline tasks from Epic 1
- Connection lines showing task dependencies and data flow
- Task configuration panels within DAG interface
- Save/load DAG configurations
- DAG validation (circular dependency detection, required connections)

## Story 2: Pipeline Orchestration Engine
**Goal:** Implement data-engine backend for pipeline execution, task dependency resolution, and workflow state management

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Pipeline execution engine that respects task dependencies
- Task scheduling based on dependency completion
- Pipeline state management (running, paused, failed, completed)
- Error handling and retry logic for failed tasks
- Pipeline execution history and logging
- Support for parallel task execution where dependencies allow

## Story 3: Pipeline Monitoring & Management Dashboard
**Goal:** Build pipeline execution monitoring, status tracking, and management controls within data-terminal interface

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Real-time pipeline execution dashboard
- Individual task status within pipeline view
- Pipeline execution logs and error messages
- Pipeline management controls (start, pause, stop, restart)
- Pipeline execution history and metrics
- Alert system for pipeline failures or delays
