# Summary for AI Agents

This data-terminal component provides the **foundational management layer** for the data-factory platform but requires significant extension for full ETL/DAG/AI capabilities. Current implementation handles project, resource, and datasource CRUD operations with a modern Rust/WebAssembly stack.

**Key areas for AI-generated code enhancement:**
1. Workflow orchestration engine integration
2. DAG processing node implementations
3. Communication bridges to data-engine (Java) and data-agent (Python)
4. Enhanced error handling for data processing workflows
5. Real-time status monitoring and logging systems

The architecture is well-structured for extension, following clean architecture principles with proper dependency injection and separation of concerns.
