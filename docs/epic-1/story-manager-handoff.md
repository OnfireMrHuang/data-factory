# Story Manager Handoff

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic focusing on core MySQL pipeline tasks. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running Java/Spring Boot with Maven modules
- Integration points: data-engine-service (task execution), data-engine-dao (database access), data-terminal (task configuration UI)
- Existing patterns to follow: Maven module structure, Spring Boot service patterns, TailwindCSS/DaisyUI components
- Critical compatibility requirements: Maintain existing data-engine API contracts, preserve ETL functionality isolation
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should establish foundational task types (datasource config, SQL transformation, data sync) that will support future pipeline orchestration."
