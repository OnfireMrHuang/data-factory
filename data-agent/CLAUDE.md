# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a data analysis agent project built with Python and LLM technologies. The project is currently in early development stage with only initial planning documentation.

**Primary Technologies:**
- Python (main programming language)  
- Large Language Models (LLM) for AI capabilities
- LangChain framework for LLM applications
- LangGraph for complex agent workflows
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) by Anthropic for tool integration

## Project Goals

- Build an AI agent for data analysis tasks
- Help developers quickly create SQL operators and Java/Scala operators  
- Enable rapid system orchestration capabilities
- Support classical ML models (classification, recommendation) when LLM approaches aren't suitable

## Development Status

This repository currently contains only planning documentation. The actual codebase has not yet been implemented.

## Development Setup

Since the project is in planning stage, no specific development commands are available yet. Once implementation begins, this section should be updated with:
- Python environment setup instructions
- Dependency installation commands
- Testing and linting commands
- Build and deployment procedures
- use uv to run python files or add any dependencies
