# Current State vs. Expected ETL/AI Capabilities

## What EXISTS Currently

✅ **Foundation Layer Complete:**
- Project lifecycle management with status tracking
- Infrastructure resource registration and configuration
- Data source connection management and status monitoring
- Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Async Rust backend with compile-time SQL validation
- Modern React-like frontend with WebAssembly performance

## What is MISSING for ETL/DAG/AI Integration

❌ **ETL Pipeline Logic:** No workflow orchestration engine
❌ **DAG Implementation:** No directed acyclic graph processing
❌ **AI Workflow Integration:** No AI agent coordination
❌ **Data Transformation:** No actual data processing capabilities
❌ **Batch Processing:** No job scheduling or execution
❌ **Stream Processing:** No real-time data handling

## **Integration Point with data-engine**

The current data-terminal serves as a **management interface** that will orchestrate the Java-based data-engine component (located at `../data-engine/`) which contains the actual ETL processing capabilities. The integration pattern is:

1. **data-terminal**: Project/resource/datasource configuration and monitoring
2. **data-engine**: Actual ETL execution, job scheduling, and data processing
3. **data-agent**: AI-powered workflow generation and optimization
