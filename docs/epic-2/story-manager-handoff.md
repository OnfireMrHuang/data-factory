# Story Manager Handoff

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic focusing on DAG pipeline orchestration. Key considerations:

- This enhancement builds upon Epic 1's core pipeline tasks foundation
- Integration points: Existing task management APIs, data-terminal UI framework, data-engine orchestration
- Existing patterns to follow: Established task execution patterns, UI component structure
- Critical compatibility requirements: Individual task functionality must remain unchanged, no breaking changes to task APIs
- Each story must include verification that existing task execution continues working

The epic should enable visual workflow creation while preserving all individual task capabilities from Epic 1."
