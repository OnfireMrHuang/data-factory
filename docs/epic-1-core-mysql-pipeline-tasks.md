# Epic 1: Core MySQL Pipeline Tasks - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Enable users to configure MySQL datasources, perform SQL-based data transformations, and sync data to external MySQL destinations through individual task management, building foundation for pipeline orchestration.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Data-Factory has basic ETL framework with data-engine modules (API, service, DAO, web) and data-terminal configuration interface
- Technology stack: Java/Spring Boot backend (v2.2.10), Maven modules, TailwindCSS frontend with DaisyUI
- Integration points: Existing data-engine execution engine, data-terminal configuration UI, MySQL connectivity infrastructure

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Core pipeline task types - datasource config, collection tasks (batch/stream), SQL transformation (scheduled/realtime), data sync to external MySQL
- How it integrates: Extends data-engine-service with task management, enhances data-terminal UI with task configuration forms, leverages existing data-engine-dao for database connectivity
- Success criteria: Users can create and execute individual MySQL pipeline tasks independently

## User Journey - Epic 1

1. **User configures MySQL datasource** with connection parameters and validation
2. **User configures MySQL resource** for target data warehouse (MySQL/Doris)
3. **User adds collection task** for gathering data via batch or stream mode
4. **User adds table development task** for SQL-based data cleaning and transformation

## Stories

### Story 1: MySQL Datasource & Resource Configuration
**Goal:** Create data-terminal UI for configuring MySQL datasources and resources with connection validation and batch/stream collection task setup

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can configure MySQL datasource connection parameters
- Connection validation provides immediate feedback
- Users can configure MySQL/Doris target resources
- Batch and stream collection modes are selectable
- Configuration persists in data-engine database

### Story 2: SQL Data Transformation & Table Development  
**Goal:** Implement data-engine backend for SQL-based data cleaning and transformation with scheduling/realtime execution modes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can create SQL transformation tasks
- Support for scheduled execution mode
- Support for realtime execution mode
- SQL validation and syntax checking
- Transformation results stored appropriately

### Story 3: External MySQL Data Sync Tasks
**Goal:** Build data sync functionality to transfer transformed data to external MySQL destinations with configurable sync parameters

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can configure external MySQL sync targets
- Support for full data sync mode
- Support for incremental data sync mode
- Sync parameter configuration (batch size, frequency)
- Sync status monitoring and error handling

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing data-engine APIs remain unchanged
- [ ] Database schema changes are backward compatible (new task tables only)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing TailwindCSS/DaisyUI patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (async task execution)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Multiple execution modes (batch/stream, scheduled/realtime) complexity
- **Mitigation:** Implement each task type incrementally, use existing data-engine patterns, comprehensive testing
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable new task types via feature flags, maintain existing ETL functionality isolation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All 3 stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Individual task types functional independently
- [ ] Existing data-engine functionality verified through testing
- [ ] Both batch/stream collection modes working correctly
- [ ] SQL transformation supporting scheduled/realtime execution
- [ ] Full and incremental sync modes operational
- [ ] No regression in existing ETL features

## Technical Integration Points

**Data-Engine Modules:**
- `data-engine-service`: Task execution logic and scheduling
- `data-engine-dao`: Database connectivity and data access
- `data-engine-api`: REST endpoints for task management
- `data-engine-web`: Task monitoring and status endpoints

**Data-Terminal:**
- Configuration UI components for each task type
- Task creation and management interfaces
- Status monitoring dashboards

## Story Manager Handoff

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic focusing on core MySQL pipeline tasks. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running Java/Spring Boot with Maven modules
- Integration points: data-engine-service (task execution), data-engine-dao (database access), data-terminal (task configuration UI)
- Existing patterns to follow: Maven module structure, Spring Boot service patterns, TailwindCSS/DaisyUI components
- Critical compatibility requirements: Maintain existing data-engine API contracts, preserve ETL functionality isolation
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should establish foundational task types (datasource config, SQL transformation, data sync) that will support future pipeline orchestration."

## Success Criteria

Epic 1 is successful when:

1. Users can configure MySQL datasources with validation
2. Collection tasks support both batch and stream modes
3. SQL transformation tasks execute in scheduled/realtime modes
4. Data sync tasks transfer data to external MySQL destinations
5. All task types operate independently without dependencies
6. Existing data-engine functionality remains unaffected

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- Current data-engine infrastructure
- Existing MySQL connectivity capabilities
- Data-terminal UI framework

**Prepares for:**
- Epic 2: DAG Pipeline Orchestration
- Future pipeline workflow capabilities
