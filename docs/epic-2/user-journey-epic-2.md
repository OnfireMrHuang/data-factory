# User Journey - Epic 2

Building on Epic 1's individual tasks, users can now:

1. **User creates visual DAG workflow** by combining existing tasks (datasource → collection → transformation → sync)
2. **User defines task dependencies** and execution order through drag-and-drop interface
3. **User monitors pipeline execution** with real-time status and progress tracking
4. **User manages pipeline lifecycle** (start, stop, schedule, modify)
