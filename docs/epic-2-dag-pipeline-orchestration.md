# Epic 2: DAG Pipeline Orchestration - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Enable users to combine existing MySQL pipeline tasks (datasource, transformation, sync) into visual DAG workflows with orchestration and monitoring capabilities, building upon the core pipeline tasks foundation.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Core MySQL pipeline tasks (Epic 1), existing data-engine task execution infrastructure
- Technology stack: Java/Spring Boot backend with established task management, TailwindCSS frontend with DaisyUI
- Integration points: Existing task types (datasource, transformation, sync), data-engine execution engine, data-terminal UI framework

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Visual DAG designer, pipeline workflow orchestration, task dependency management, pipeline execution monitoring
- How it integrates: Extends data-terminal UI with DAG visualization, enhances data-engine with pipeline orchestration logic
- Success criteria: Users can create visual DAG pipelines combining existing tasks with dependency management and execution monitoring

## User Journey - Epic 2

Building on Epic 1's individual tasks, users can now:

1. **User creates visual DAG workflow** by combining existing tasks (datasource → collection → transformation → sync)
2. **User defines task dependencies** and execution order through drag-and-drop interface
3. **User monitors pipeline execution** with real-time status and progress tracking
4. **User manages pipeline lifecycle** (start, stop, schedule, modify)

## Stories

### Story 1: DAG Visual Designer Interface
**Goal:** Create data-terminal UI component for drag-and-drop DAG creation using existing MySQL pipeline tasks with visual workflow representation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Visual canvas for DAG creation with drag-and-drop functionality
- Task palette showing available pipeline tasks from Epic 1
- Connection lines showing task dependencies and data flow
- Task configuration panels within DAG interface
- Save/load DAG configurations
- DAG validation (circular dependency detection, required connections)

### Story 2: Pipeline Orchestration Engine
**Goal:** Implement data-engine backend for pipeline execution, task dependency resolution, and workflow state management

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Pipeline execution engine that respects task dependencies
- Task scheduling based on dependency completion
- Pipeline state management (running, paused, failed, completed)
- Error handling and retry logic for failed tasks
- Pipeline execution history and logging
- Support for parallel task execution where dependencies allow

### Story 3: Pipeline Monitoring & Management Dashboard
**Goal:** Build pipeline execution monitoring, status tracking, and management controls within data-terminal interface

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Real-time pipeline execution dashboard
- Individual task status within pipeline view
- Pipeline execution logs and error messages
- Pipeline management controls (start, pause, stop, restart)
- Pipeline execution history and metrics
- Alert system for pipeline failures or delays

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing task execution APIs remain unchanged
- [ ] Pipeline tables extend existing task infrastructure
- [ ] UI follows established TailwindCSS/DaisyUI patterns
- [ ] Individual task functionality preserved
- [ ] Epic 1 task types work seamlessly in DAG workflows

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** DAG visualization complexity and execution orchestration overhead
- **Mitigation:** Build on proven task foundation from Epic 1, implement simple DAG algorithms, progressive UI enhancement
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable pipeline features via feature flags, individual tasks remain fully functional

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All 3 stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Visual DAG creation functional with existing task types
- [ ] Pipeline orchestration executing task dependencies correctly
- [ ] Pipeline monitoring providing clear execution status
- [ ] Individual task functionality unaffected
- [ ] No performance degradation in existing task execution
- [ ] Complete user journey functional: config → collect → transform → sync → DAG

## Technical Integration Points

**Data-Engine Modules:**
- `data-engine-service`: Pipeline orchestration logic and execution engine
- `data-engine-dao`: Pipeline and workflow persistence
- `data-engine-api`: Pipeline management REST endpoints
- `data-engine-web`: Pipeline monitoring and status APIs

**Data-Terminal:**
- DAG visual designer component
- Pipeline monitoring dashboard
- Pipeline management interface

**Dependencies on Epic 1:**
- Task execution APIs for datasource configuration
- Task execution APIs for data collection
- Task execution APIs for SQL transformation
- Task execution APIs for data sync

## Story Manager Handoff

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic focusing on DAG pipeline orchestration. Key considerations:

- This enhancement builds upon Epic 1's core pipeline tasks foundation
- Integration points: Existing task management APIs, data-terminal UI framework, data-engine orchestration
- Existing patterns to follow: Established task execution patterns, UI component structure
- Critical compatibility requirements: Individual task functionality must remain unchanged, no breaking changes to task APIs
- Each story must include verification that existing task execution continues working

The epic should enable visual workflow creation while preserving all individual task capabilities from Epic 1."

## Success Criteria

Epic 2 is successful when:

1. Users can visually create DAG workflows using Epic 1 tasks
2. Pipeline orchestration correctly manages task dependencies
3. Pipeline monitoring provides real-time execution visibility
4. Complete user journey works end-to-end (config → collect → transform → sync → DAG)
5. Individual task functionality from Epic 1 remains unchanged
6. System performance maintains acceptable levels during pipeline execution

## Delivery Sequence

**Recommended Delivery Order:**
1. **Epic 1 First** - Establishes core task functionality
2. **Epic 2 Second** - Adds orchestration layer on proven foundation

This approach ensures incremental value delivery and reduces integration risks while maintaining the complete user journey vision.

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- Epic 1: Core MySQL Pipeline Tasks completed
- All individual task types operational
- Task execution APIs established

**Enables:**
- Complete MySQL-to-Data Warehouse pipeline workflows
